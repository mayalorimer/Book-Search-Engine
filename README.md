# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This application is a refactor of a fully functional Google Books API into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
